*quickly* scaffold out a react project

uses:
- react for view layer
- browserify for bundling modules for browser
- budo for a browserify development server (with options enabled for live reloading)
- babelify to allow you to write ES6 if your heart desires

this is **super** subject to change, cause i don't really know too much about this stuff. i just wanted a super minimal scaffold to kick my projects off with that doesn't do anything i don't understand yet.

for a more complete / useful static page scaffolder, see https://github.com/ahdinosaur/slush-pages (which i drew inspiration from)
